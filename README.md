Predicting Solar Power Output using Linear Regression ☀️🔍
Overview
This project predicts solar power output using Linear Regression. The model takes various environmental and technical parameters as input and provides an estimated power generation value.

It includes:

Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, duplicate removal, visualization)
Machine Learning Model (Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn)
Performance Evaluation (R² Score, RMSE, MAE)
Interactive UI (Built with Tkinter for user-friendly predictions)

Methodology 🔬
Data Loading: Read dataset using pandas.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Handle missing values, check distributions.
Feature Selection & Engineering: Choose relevant variables for prediction.
Model Training:
Use train_test_split to divide data.
Apply LinearRegression from Scikit-Learn.
Model Evaluation:
Calculate Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Compute R² Score for accuracy.
Measure Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for better error understanding.
GUI Integration: Use tkinter for user-friendly input & output.
Results 📊
Model Performance
Metric	Value
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)	507.53
R-squared Score (R²)	0.718
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) - 1st run	391.79
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) - 2nd run	392.42
Interpretation
R² Score (0.718): The model explains 71.8% of the variance in solar power output.
RMSE (507.53): The model's average error magnitude is 507.53 kW, indicating some scope for improvement.
MAE (~392 kW): The average absolute difference between predictions and actual values is around 392 kW.
Conclusion: The model performs reasonably well but can be improved with feature engineering and additional data sources.
